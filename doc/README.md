#### **Note:**
wit-intro-2 refers to WIT as "Watson Implosion Technology".
Please note that WIT has nothing to do with **Watson**, IBM's portfolio of AI tools, applications and solutions.
"Watson Implosion Technology" was simply the internal name for WIT before it became open-source.
(The name dates from a time before IBM's Watson AI portfolio existed.)
Since wit-intro-2 is a frozen PDF file, which has not been not revised since before WIT became open-source, it still uses the old name.
