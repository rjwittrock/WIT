This file was created to try to find a bug that is noticed in
scenario/src/lastPrbS.C around line 1350, on the line that says
  assert( lenCritList > 0 );

The bug is probably that WIT 4.0 heuristic says this problem has
no critical parts but WIT 3.4 heuristic says it has at least one.
The problem is the denise one with small modifications that are
made in the LPS::contextTest method.
